[[MavenRepositoryScanner]]
== Scanner for remote Maven repositories
Downloads the repository index and retrieves all available new artifacts for scanning.

This plugin should be triggered on the command line by providing an URL and a specific scope:

Examples: 
[source,bash]
----
>jqassistant.cmd scan -u maven:repository::http://[<user>:<password>@]<repository url>
>jqassistant.cmd scan -u maven:repository::http://foo:bar@example.com/m2repo
----

TIP: The plugin supports incremental runs on a maven repository. In this case only new artifacts will be downloaded and
scanned.

TIP: For incremental scanning it is necessary that the exactly the same URL is provided on sub-sequent scans.
